I've added comments and changed a few things based on comments on his YouTube Channel, differences in editions,
and places where I saw room for improvement.  I have found clones of this repository to work inconsistently 
based on godot doing weird things with tilemaps, but I've put this here as a copy and paste resource for students
following along with the tutorial.  I think it is best that you create your own projects and add the files and 
animations and such so as to learn to use the editor.
